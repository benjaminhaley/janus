To promote a long and healthy life, most soft tissue tumors were removed surgically under anesthesia, however, bone tumors were never removed. Particular emphasis has been given to bone fractures, the location of osteosarcomas and the evaluation of tumor growth rates based on sequential radiographs of the expanding tumors. At autopsy, the bones were defleshed and postmortem X-rays showing two views of each bone were taken to identify possible tumor sites that were then examined histologically.|1001-7-6-1395|6|2300|Osteosarcoma, malignant,|Skeletal bone,|OSTEOSARCOMA,|
