<meta name="description" content="This book is the seventh in a series of titles from the National Research Council that addresses the effects of exposure to low dose LET (Linear Energy Transfer) ionizing radiation and human health. Updating information previously presented in the 1990 publication, Health Effects of Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation: BEIR V, this book draws upon new data in both epidemiologic and experimental research. Ionizing radiation arises from both natural and man-made sources and at very high doses can produce damaging effects in human tissue that can be evident within days after exposure. However, it is the low-dose exposures that are the focus of this book. So-called  late  effects, such as cancer, are produced many years after the initial exposure. This book is among the first of its kind to include detailed risk estimates for cancer incidence in addition to cancer mortality. BEIR VII offers a full review of the available biological, biophysical, and epidemiological literature since the last BEIR report on the subject and develops the most up-to-date and comprehensive risk estimates for cancer and other health effects from exposure to low-level ionizing radiation.">

    <h2 class="chaptertitle"><strong>2</strong><br><strong>Molecular and Cellular Responses to Ionizing Radiation</strong></h2>
  </div>

  <p class="bodytextfp">Since the early years of radiobiology the cellular effects of ionizing radiation have been studied in the context of induced chromosomal aberrations, and early models of radiation action were largely based upon such studies (Savage 1996). In the 1970s, somatic cell genetic techniques were developed to allow the quantification and characterization of specific gene mutations arising in irradiated cultures of somatic cells. In more recent years, findings of persistent postirradiation genomic instability, bystander effects, and other types of cellular response have posed additional questions regarding the mechanisms underlying the cytogenetic and mutagenic effects of radiation and their potential to contribute to radiation tumorigenesis.</p>

  <p class="bodytext">This chapter considers the general aspects of dose-response relationships for radiobiological effects and subsequently reviews the largely cellular data on a range of radiobiological end points. The main focus of the review is the issue of cellular effects at low doses of low-LET (linear energy transfer) radiation. Many of the conclusions reached from this review, when aggregated with those of Chapters <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11340&page=19#p2000e6f39970019001">1</a> and <a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11340&page=65#p2000e6f39970065001">3</a>, contribute to the judgments made in this report about human cancer risk at low doses and low dose rates.</p><a id="p2000e6f39970043002"></a>

  <div class="aaheadtitlegroup">
    <h3 class="aahead"><strong>GENERAL ASPECTS OF DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS</strong></h3>
  </div>

  <p class="bodytextfp">Any effect of radiation exposure must be quantified in relation to the effect observed in a control population. In this way the dose to an irradiated population is considered in the context of, among other factors, the natural background radiation received. For low-LET radiation an absorbed dose of 1Gy<sup><a href="http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11340&page=43#p2000e6f38960043001">1</a></sup> (1000 mGy) corresponds to an equivalent dose of 1 Sv (1000 mSv). Because this report focuses on low-LET radiation, reference is mostly to grays and not to sieverts. Low-LET background radiation worldwide is responsible for an average annual effective dose per person of about 0.9 mGy per year (UNSCEAR 2000b). This includes an estimated 0.48 mGy from external terrestrial radiation to the body, 0.28 mGy from cosmic radiation (excluding the neutron component), and 0.17 mGy from radioisotopes in the body. For the purposes of this report, it does not include background radiation of about 1.2 mSv delivered to the lungs from radon and radon progeny or other high-LET radiation. Radon is the subject of the BEIR VI report (NRC 1999).</p>

  <p class="bodytext">The maximal permissible levels that are recommended in the United States by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) for people exposed to radiation other than background radiation and from medical applications are 1 mSv per year for the general population and 50 mSv per year for radiation workers employed by nuclear-related industries (Federal Register 1987). Considering the levels of background radiation, the maximal permissible levels of exposure of radiation workers now in effect, and the fact that much of the epidemiology of low-dose exposures includes people who in the past have received up to 500 mSv, the BEIR VII committee has focused on evaluating radiation effects in the low-dose range &lt;100 mGy, with emphasis on the lowest doses where relevant data are available. Effects that may occur as the radiation is delivered chronically over several months to a lifetime are thought to be most relevant.</p>

  <p class="bodytext">An effect (E) (for example chromosomal aberrations, mutations, or animal carcinogenesis) induced by an acute dose of low-LET radiation delivered over a few minutes has been described by the relationship E = α<em>D</em> + β<em>D</em><sup>2</sup>, where <em>D</em> = dose; this is a linear-quadratic dose-response relationship curving upward (Lea 1946; Cox and others 1977). Theoretically, the α term represents the single-hit intratrack component, and β represents the two-hit intertrack component. An alternative interpretation is that the <em>D</em><sup>2</sup> term may arise from multiple tracks that would increase the overall burden of damage in a cell and thereby partially saturate a repair</p>

AT and XR-V15B cell lines (Skov 1999) or with high-LET
radiation (Lambin and others 1993). For doses above 50–
200 mGy, for which HRS is no longer observed, the flatten-
ing of the survival curve between 500 and 1000 mGy may be
related to DNA PKcs activity (Marples and others 2002) or
to the downregulation of the DIR1 gene (Robson and others
1997, 1999); this downregulation has been shown to corre-
late with an increase in rate of repair of DNA single-strand
breaks (Robson and others 2000; Collis and others 2004;
Marples and others 2004).
    DNA damage introduced at a very low rate may not acti-
vate the radiation damage sensor ATM (Collis and others
2004). Consequently, exposure to low levels of chronic ra-
diation may cause more cell damage than estimated from
extrapolation of higher doses. This hypersensitivity to kill-
ing could serve to eliminate cells that have received DNA
damage and potentially carcinogenic changes to their ge-
nome. Alternatively, it cannot presently be excluded that            FIGURE 2-4 Maximal induction of CDKN1A ( ), GADD45 ( ),
