Mortality tends to increase exponentially [1].  Gavrilov says this can be explained as a system of rendundant peices with a constant failure rates [2].

That is, aging is the manifestation of a constant failure rate of redundant pieces.  An interesting insight with regards to radiation.  Maybe radiation is causing some part of a redundant system to fail, thereby increasing the time to death.

In any case here's a simulation of Gavrilov's idea to show it is plausible.

```{r}

# Redundant critical elements
cells <- 1000

# Failure rate
fail <- 0.1

# Hahah never mind, it is obvious without ever programming that this
# must follow an exponential decay!
