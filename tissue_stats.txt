tissue_stats.txt
	to work with Amit to produce paper bound statistics on the argonne irradiated tissue sets


To Do:	
	Organize Project - read data_organization.txt
	union Dog Details U Maligancy by Location (pivot veiw) U Malignancies by System (pivot view)
	if parents had prostate trouble
	Multilevel Linear Modeling, Power Analysis
	snomed, heredity, parisites, study groups, estrus problems


Prostate Analysis
	Good Source says that BPH and Prostate cancer are not related http://www.springerlink.com/content/w127756387122244/
	Does dose or dose rate increase the chances of prostate cancer
	So far they are insignificant and do not improve the model (see superprostate_june4.smcl, radio_prostate, and prostate)

Algorithm:
	1. Produce all cross variables (including self*self)
	2. Run all possible regressions on unirradiated dogs
		a. optimize for aic and bic goodness of fit 
		b. enusure that the models pass the lr test
	3. Check for outliers and update parameters if necessary
	4. Apply the model to irradiated dogs, see if dose and dose rate improve the model and how
	5. Before drawing non-dose conclusions from the model be sure to check for co-linearity problems



Other Studies:
	Systems Analysis	Prove that The effects of Radiation are wholebody/systemic
	Age Effects		The age of first exposure vs its potency per dose
	Radiation Cancers	Which cancers are more common in irradiated animals ( choose the top cancers )


Data	SuperDog.dta, SuperMouse.dta
